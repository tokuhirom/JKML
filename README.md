        # heh.
        input => "hoghoge",
        expected => "hogehoge",
        description => <<-EOF,
        This markup language is human writable.
        
        JKML supports following features:

          * heredoc
          * raw string.
          * comments
        EOF
        regexp => r" ^^ \s+ ",
      }

# DESCRIPTION

JKML is parser library for JKML. JKML is yet another markup language.

## What's difference between JSON?

JKML extends following features:

- Raw strings
- Comments

# JKML and encoding

You MUST use UTF-8 for every JKML data.

# JKML Grammar

- Raw strings

    JKML allows raw strings. Such as following:

        raw_string =
              "r'" .*? "'"
            | 'r"' .*? '"'
            | 'r"""' .*? '"""'
            | "r'''" .*? "'''"

    Every raw string literals does not care about non terminater characters.

        r'hoge'
        r"hoge"
        r"""hoge"""
        r'''hoge'''

- Comments

    Perl5 style comemnt is allowed.

        # comment

- String

    String literal is compatible with JSON.

            string = sqstring | dqstring

             dqstring = '"' dqchar* '"'
             sqstring = "'" sqchar* "'"

             dqchar = unescaped | "'" | escaped
             sqchar = unescaped | '"' | escaped

             escaped = escape (
                        %x22 /          ; "    quotation mark  U+0022
                        %x5C /          ; \    reverse solidus U+005C
                        %x2F /          ; /    solidus         U+002F
                        %x62 /          ; b    backspace       U+0008
                        %x66 /          ; f    form feed       U+000C
                        %x6E /          ; n    line feed       U+000A
                        %x72 /          ; r    carriage return U+000D
                        %x74 /          ; t    tab             U+0009
                        %x75 4HEXDIG )  ; uXXXX                U+XXXX

             escape = %x5C              ; \

             quotation-mark = %x22      ; "

             unescaped = [^"'\]

- Number

    Number literal is compatible with JSON. See JSON RFC.

        3
        3.14
        3e14

- Map

    Map literal's grammar is:

        pair = string "=>" value
        map = "{" "}"
            | "{" pair ( "," pair )* ","?  "}"

    You can omit quotes for keys, if you don't want to type it.

    You can use trailing comma unlike JS.

    Examples:

        {
            a => 3,
            "b" => 4,
        }

- Array

        array = "[" "]"
              | "[" value ( "," value )* ","? "]"

    Examples:

        [1,2,3]
        [1,2,3,]

- heredoc

    Ruby style heredoc.

        <<-TOC
        hoghoge
        TOC

- Value

        value = map | array | string | raw_string | number | funcall
- Boolean

        bool = "true" | "false"
- NULL

        null = "null"

    Will decode to `undef`.

- Function call

        funcall = ident "(" value ")"
        ident = [a-zA-Z_] [a-zA-Z0-9_]*

    JKML supports some builtin functions.

# Builtin functions

- base64

    Decode base64 string.

        base64(string)
